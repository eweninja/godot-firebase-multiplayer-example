# godot-firebase-multiplayer-example


Example project in Godot 4.1 using [GodotFirebase](https://github.com/GodotNuts/GodotFirebase).

**Work in progress**.

## Reason

I'm creating this project for reference, as a basic example of creating multiplayer in Godot 4 using Firebase (mostly Firebase Realtime Database).
